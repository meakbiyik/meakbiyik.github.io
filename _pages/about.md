AI researcher, entrepreneur, wine enthusiast, occasional blogger.

I think about multimodal AI, human intent modeling, and multi-agent learning using game-theoretical tools. Currently working towards superforecasting.

Otherwise find me organizing wine tastings, reading Ursula Le Guin, and writing about art, wine, and other things.

If you are thinking about similar problems, feel free to send a message. If you have a good bottle of Marcel Deiss, feel free to send a dinner invite.
