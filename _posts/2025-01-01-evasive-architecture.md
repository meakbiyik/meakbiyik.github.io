I asked many architecture students in ZÃ¼rich what they thought of Kornhaus, the bane of my existence as it defiled the view of my balcony for over 4 years. All seemed bored by the question, and the contempt in their response correlated with their commendation of the building. "Concrete," one said, "the choice of concrete and other materials," when I asked what made that grey rectangle remarkable.

As with these students building our bleak, rectangular future, I've encountered other experts choosing quantifiable over likeable in their respective fields. Renowned wine critics used "flawless" as their highest praise when inquiring about some soulless, oaky red liquid. Gourmets described their branch of celery as "crunchy and delicious" in the second course of their fancy fine dining experience. Then, what unites this disturbingly wrong group of people?

The issue here is composite: first, our need for modeling the complex simplifies it, as we describe a topic, potentially an artistic one, in a few ill-posed dimensions whose maxima do not align with our intuitions that better capture the topic (albeit inexplicably). For example, the quality standards of a building in modern European architecture concerns itself mostly with practicality and safety, leading to the perfectly optimal shape of a cat carrier.

Second, our incentives do not reflect the remaining aspects of a beautiful design, as whatever effort not included in the optimization task is spent on reducing costs. Hence, that cat carrier is left as raw concrete, without any color or artistic additions.

Third, our desire to avoid failure, both as an expert and as an artistic human being, prevents us from pushing forward. As a gray cat box in the name of a living space is obviously disgustingly insulting to all that is human, and there is no space for mistakes in improving upon established metrics, we have successfully found an excuse and called it brutalist, so that it finds a valid place in our field of expertise.

Yet, however much the current teachings empty out their meaning, what we build today is not brutalist like the Barbican, just as a scientifically perfect 1980s Pinot from Burgundy is not a good wine [^1]. What we have today is evasive architecture, evading costs and risks, without a basis for making something beautiful, somewhat like software developers in a large bank evading open source in favor of an IBM mainframe.

Call out what is horrible, and punish those who evade! Discourage simplicity in art, similarity in architecture, and stupidity in all other fields, by protecting those who occasionally make a mistake or two.
