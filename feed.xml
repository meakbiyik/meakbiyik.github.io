Most seemed bored by the question, and the contempt in their response correlated with their commendation of the building. “Concrete,” one said, “the choice of concrete and other materials,” when I asked what made that grey rectangle remarkable.</p> <p>As with these students building our bleak, rectangular future, I’ve encountered other experts choosing quantifiable over likeable. Renowned wine critics used “flawless” as their highest praise when inquiring about some soulless, oaky red liquid. Gourmets described their branch of celery as “crunchy and delicious” in the second course of their fancy fine dining experience. Then, I thought, what unites these disturbingly wrong groups of people?</p> <p>The issue here is composite: first, our need for modeling the complex simplifies it, as we describe a topic, potentially an artistic one, in a few ill-posed dimensions whose maxima do not align with our intuitions that better capture the topic (albeit inexplicably). A wine can be both flawless and bad if your sole dimensions are the acidity and sugar levels. In the same spirit, the quality standards of a building in modern European architecture concerns itself mostly with practicality and safety, leading to the perfectly optimal shape of a cat carrier.</p> <p>Second, our incentives do not reflect the remaining aspects of a beautiful design, as whatever effort not included in the optimization task is spent on reducing costs. Hence, that cat carrier is left as raw concrete, without any color or decoration.</p> <p>Third, our desire to avoid failure, both as an expert and as an artistic human being, prevents us from pushing forward. As a gray cat box in the name of a living space is obviously disgustingly insulting to all that is human, and there is no space for mistakes in improving upon established metrics, we have successfully found an excuse and called it brutalist, so that it finds a valid place in our field of expertise.</p> <p>Yet, however much the current teachings empty out their meaning, what we build today is not brutalist like the Barbican, just as a scientifically perfect 1980s Pinot from Burgundy is not a good wine <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. What we have today is evasive architecture, evading costs and risks, without a basis for making something beautiful, somewhat like software developers in a large bank evading open source in favor of an IBM mainframe.</p> <p>Call out what is horrible, and punish those who evade! Discourage simplicity in art, similarity in architecture, and stupidity in all other fields, by protecting those who occasionally make a mistake or two.</p> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1"> <p>An important article on the topic from Michel Bettane: <a href="https://www.mybettanedesseauve.fr/2024/07/15/la-bourgogne-limpasse-et-lissue">https://www.mybettanedesseauve.fr/2024/07/15/la-bourgogne-limpasse-et-lissue</a> <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> </ol> </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="architecture"/><category term="architecture,"/><category term="art,"/><category term="brutalism,"/><category term="evasive-architecture"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Exploring evasiveness in architecture and other artistic fields.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">On the enduring dislike of contemporary art</title><link href="https://meakbiyik.com/blog/2024/contemporary-art/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="On the enduring dislike of contemporary art"/><published>2024-10-20T15:09:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-10-20T15:09:00+00:00</updated><id>https://meakbiyik.com/blog/2024/contemporary-art</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://meakbiyik.com/blog/2024/contemporary-art/"><![CDATA[<p>It is hard for an average person to connect with contemporary art. I had convinced myself in a theory of an “inside joke” among artists: not that they create ridiculous imagery, but they challenge themselves and each other to explore the boundaries of certain artistic dimensions. Consequently, for those who are far removed from such boundaries, the works remain indistinct. And it follows that contemporary art should not be commonplace for common people, but should be provided, in free but separate format, for artists themselves.</p> <p>Yet this theory overlooks the challenges of humanity. Although post-impressionism and all subsequent avant-garde movements followed impressionism, which itself pushed beyond academism and others in natural succession, there was a certain theme in many powerful avant-garde art that emerged through 20th century, highly connected to the pain and savagery of their era. Their own empathy assigned a certain responsibility to artists, in depicting not a utopia, but the dismembered human beings, distorted collective psyche, and all that’s lost or destroyed. This angle is valuable enough to recognize not only for critics of contemporary art, but also the artists who, in pursuing originality, might benefit from understanding why their predecessors first shattered conventional forms.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="art"/><category term="contemporary-art"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A discussion on contemporary art's deliberate inaccessibility versus its inherent sensitivity.]]></summary></entry></feed>
